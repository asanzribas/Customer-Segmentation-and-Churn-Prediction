The telecommunications company Telco finds itself facing a pressing challenge â€“ a significant 26% of its customer base has opted to discontinue services in the last month. Recognising the critical need to address this surge in customer churn, Telco has decided to leverage data science in understanding and mitigating this trend.

Telco provided a data set with the following information:

* Customers who left within the last month 
* Services that each customer has signed up for
* Customer account information: How long they have been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
* Demographic info: Gender, age range, and if customers have partners and dependents

The mission is clear: develop predictive models to understand which customers are more likely to switch to competitors and what factors contribute to it. This data-driven approach will empower Telco to make informed decisions, implement targeted strategies, and proactively engage with customers to address their concerns and increase customer satisfaction.

The contributions of the customer churn prediction models will play a pivotal role in not only reshaping Telco's customer retention strategies but also building a more resilient and customer-centric telecommunications ecosystem.
