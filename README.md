INTRODUCTION

The telecommunications company Telco finds itself facing a pressing challenge â€“ a significant 26% of its customer base has opted to discontinue services in the last month. Recognising the critical need to address this surge in customer churn, Telco has decided to leverage data science in understanding and mitigating this trend.

Telco provided a data set with the following information:

* Customers who left within the last month 
* Services that each customer has signed up for
* Customer account information: How long they have been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
* Demographic info: Gender, age range, and if customers have partners and dependents

The mission is clear: develop predictive models to understand which customers are more likely to switch to competitors and what factors contribute to it. This data-driven approach will empower Telco to make informed decisions, implement targeted strategies, and proactively engage with customers to address their concerns and increase customer satisfaction.

The contributions of the customer churn prediction models will play a pivotal role in not only reshaping Telco's customer retention strategies but also building a more resilient and customer-centric telecommunications ecosystem.

SEGMENTATION ANALYSIS

In the context of a customer churn prediction project, clustering can be relevant for several reasons:

- Identifying Customer Segments: Clustering can help identify distinct groups or segments of customers with similar behavior, preferences, or characteristics. Understanding these segments can provide valuable insights into the different types of customers Telco has.

- Feature Engineering: Clustering can be used to create new features for predictive modeling. For example, assigning a cluster label to each customer can serve as an additional feature that captures the inherent patterns within the data.

- Targeted Marketing Strategies: Once customer segments are identified, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies and retention efforts to address the specific needs and preferences of each cluster. This can improve the effectiveness of retention campaigns.

- Risk Assessment: Clustering can help in assessing the risk of churn for different customer segments. Some segments may be more prone to churn than others, and this information can be valuable in prioritizing efforts to retain high-risk customers.

- Model Calibration: By incorporating cluster information into predictive models, the model's accuracy in predicting customer churn may be improved. The distinct characteristics of each cluster can be used to fine-tune model parameters and enhance its predictive power.

- Anomaly Detection: Clustering can help identify outliers or anomalies within the data, which may represent unusual customer behavior. Detecting these anomalies early on can be crucial in predicting and preventing customer churn.
